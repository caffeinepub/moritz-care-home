  "summary": "The diff appears to implement the requested Dashboard Discharge fixes by adding an admin-check query hook, updating Dashboard to use per-resident discharge loading state, adding user-facing error handling (including admin-only messaging), and ensuring resident list queries are invalidated so the UI reflects Discharged status without refresh. The diff also includes additional generalized actor/connection error utilities that were not explicitly requested.",

    {
      "description": "Added/expanded generic backend connection utilities (promise timeout wrapper) beyond the specific Dashboard Discharge fix scope.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on fixing Discharge UI behavior, error handling, and admin-only visibility on resident cards; a generic timeout wrapper is not mentioned.",

    {
      "description": "Added/expanded generalized error normalization and classification helpers (network/timeout/canister-not-found, non-fatal detection, authorization detection) not specifically limited to the Discharge action.",
      "reason": "REQ-24 asks for explicit user-facing error handling for the Discharge action (including admin-only messaging). The diff adds a broad error utility likely used across the app, which is more than what was requested.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced a new authorization query hook (useIsCallerAdmin) as a standalone reusable query.",
      "reason": "REQ-25 requires preventing non-admin users from attempting admin-only actions; it does not explicitly require adding a dedicated reusable hook (though it may be a reasonable implementation choice).",
