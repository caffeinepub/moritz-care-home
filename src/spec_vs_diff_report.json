  "summary": "The diff only updates project_state.json to record pending requests; it does not add or modify the required Motoko authorization modules or any backend code. Therefore, none of the backend authorization requirements are implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Create valid, non-empty Motoko implementations for the missing authorization modules at `backend/authorization/access-control.mo` and `backend/authorization/MixinAuthorization.mo` so the backend canister compiles and no longer traps on initialization.",
      "reason": "No Motoko source files were added or modified; only project_state.json was updated, so the missing authorization modules are still not implemented.",

        "project_state.json"

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement role-based authorization (admin/editor/viewer) with an API compatible with existing `backend/main.mo` call sites (`initState`, `hasPermission`, `isAdmin`) and ensure `include MixinAuthorization(accessControlState);` composes correctly.",
      "reason": "No backend Motoko changes are present to implement roles, the required authorization API, or the mixin module; only a tracking entry was added to project_state.json.",

      "requirement": "Ensure authorization state is safely initialized and persistent across upgrades where applicable (idempotent init; stable/persistent behavior without introducing additional services) within the single-actor architecture.",
      "reason": "No backend Motoko changes are present to implement idempotent initialization or upgrade persistence for authorization state; only a tracking entry was added to project_state.json.",
