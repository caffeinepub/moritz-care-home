No clear required items appear unimplemented based on the provided diff summary, though some unrelated metadata/summary content was also changed.",

      "reason": "These changes are not requested by the BuildRequest (which is exclusively about startup/timeout/health-check logic). The only concrete evidence is that these unrelated changes are asserted inside a modified summary file rather than shown as actual code diffs.",
