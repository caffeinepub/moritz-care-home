  "summary": "REQ-8 appears implemented by adding a fixed-width (1000px) override for `html, body` inside `@media print` in `frontend/src/index.css`. REQ-9 is not evidenced in the diff because no report print view/root container files were modified to ensure consistent application of the shared print root class or to remove/mitigate responsive breakpoint behavior during printing.",

      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Audit all report print render paths and ensure each report’s printable root container opts into the shared print styles so the fixed-width print override applies consistently (Resident Profile Report, MAR Report, ADL Report, and any other report print views already present).",
      "reason": "The diff only shows changes to global CSS and metadata/summary files; there is no evidence of updates to the actual report print view components to apply a shared printable root class or to address responsive Tailwind breakpoint usage in print templates.",
