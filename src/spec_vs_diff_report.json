  "summary": "The BuildRequest is to enable resident discharge and archive (deletion) actions from the Dashboard, with a constraint not to duplicate existing Dashboard actions already implemented in frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx. The diff only modifies backend/main.mo and project_state.json; there are no frontend Dashboard changes shown, so the requested Dashboard enablement is not evidenced in this diff. The diff also includes backend/type/state changes and project metadata updates that are not requested by the BuildRequest.",
