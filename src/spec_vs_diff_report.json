  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented via switching resident/admin React Query hooks to a resilient actor pattern (timeouts + improved error handling) and updating Dashboard/ResidentProfile UI to show proper loading/error/retry states instead of empty content. REQ-3 is not implemented in the provided diff summary (no backend changes / no healthCheck method added). The diff also includes multiple unrelated UI/styling and dialog/form changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Backend must expose a public, non-authenticated health check method compatible with frontend startup diagnostics (performHealthCheck calls healthCheck()), e.g., `public query func healthCheck()` returning at least a message and timestamp.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows only frontend file modifications; there is no evidence of any backend (`backend/main.mo`) change adding or updating a `healthCheck()` method.",
