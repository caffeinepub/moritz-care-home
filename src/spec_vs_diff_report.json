  "summary": "Frontend adds a resilient actor hook with timeouts, startup watchdog (45s) and retry logic with React Query cache clearing, plus diagnostics/health-check utilities and stopped-canister error normalization. Backend changes are shown only in a truncated snippet and do not evidence the required public `healthCheck()` export. Some requirements that depend on StartupErrorScreen/ProfileSetup routing behavior are not verifiable from the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add a public, unauthenticated backend method `healthCheck()` compatible with frontend `performHealthCheck()` (returns object with `message` and optional `timestamp`).",
      "reason": "The diff summary for `backend/main.mo` is truncated and does not show any `public query func healthCheck()` definition or export, so implementation cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "While `getBackendDiagnostics()` is implemented, there is no diff evidence that `StartupErrorScreen` is updated to always display these values, nor that it avoids displaying secrets (beyond the helper’s intent).",

      "reason": "Non-fatal access control init handling is present in `useResilientActor`, and a startup-safe profile query exists, but the diff snippet for `App.tsx` is truncated before showing the actual routing/gating logic that renders/navigates to `ProfileSetup` when profile is null.",

      "reason": "Stopped-canister detection/normalization and retry behavior are implemented in utilities and `App.tsx`, but there is no diff evidence that the displayed error content in `StartupErrorScreen` is updated to explicitly present the stopped-canister message alongside diagnostics (including canister ID).",
