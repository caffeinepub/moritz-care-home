  "summary": "The diff only updates project_state.json to track the work; it does not add or modify the required Motoko authorization modules, so the backend compilation/startup restoration requirements are not implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Recreate the missing Motoko authorization module at `backend/authorization/access-control.mo` with non-trapping `initState()` and permission checks (`hasPermission`, `isAdmin`) supporting `#admin` and `#user` so `backend/main.mo` compiles and the canister can start.",
      "reason": "No files were added; only `project_state.json` was modified. There is no evidence that `backend/authorization/access-control.mo` was created or that required functions exist.",

      "requirement": "Recreate the missing Motoko authorization mixin at `backend/authorization/MixinAuthorization.mo` that can be included from `backend/main.mo` via `include MixinAuthorization(accessControlState);` and does not trap during actor initialization.",
      "reason": "No files were added; only `project_state.json` was modified. There is no evidence that `backend/authorization/MixinAuthorization.mo` was created or that it accepts the access control state and initializes safely.",
