  "summary": "Diff indicates updates primarily to ResidentProfile page to support a combined resident print report workflow, plus accompanying metadata/summary updates. Based on the truncated code and the file summaries, the print/toggle requirements appear to be addressed, but some specific acceptance-criteria details cannot be directly verified from the provided truncated code excerpt.",

    {
      "description": "Additional 'bulletproof' resident ID parsing/validation and expanded error-handling/loading-state logic on the ResidentProfile page beyond the requested print-report/toggle behavior.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on adding a combined print report with active/discontinued medication tables, an optional signature-lines toggle, and using existing print stylesheet conventions. The diff shows extra logic for residentId parsing/validation and comprehensive fetching/error-handling state variables that are not part of the stated requirements.",
