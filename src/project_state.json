  "summary": "Moritz Care Home is an Assisted Living Management System built on the Internet Computer. It provides staff authentication via Internet Identity, role-based authorization (admin/user/guest), and resident management workflows including resident intake/editing, room/bed tracking, medication management (with routes and active/discontinued status), MAR and ADL logging, and clinical tracking such as daily vitals (including optional blood glucose) and weight entries. The frontend is a React SPA (TanStack Router + React Query + shadcn/ui + Tailwind) with robust data-fetching/error handling, print-friendly resident profile reports, and consistent opaque healthcare-themed UI styling. The backend is a Motoko canister storing residents and related records in in-canister maps and includes mixins for access control and Caffeine blob-storage maintenance operations. The repo now also includes a reusable build/deploy template (Dockerfile, ICP canister YAMLs, scripts, and frontend lint rules) to standardize packaging and deployment.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Internet Computer architecture: Motoko canister backend (actor) + React SPA frontend using an agent-based actor interface.",
    "Role-based access control implemented as a reusable Motoko mixin; first authorized initializer can become admin based on a shared secret token.",
    "Frontend uses TanStack React Query for all backend I/O with cache invalidation/refetch patterns keyed by stable query keys (e.g., residentId as string).",
    "Frontend uses TanStack Router for routing (Dashboard and Resident Profile routes) and gates app access via an authenticated identity + user profile presence.",
    "Date/time stored as nanoseconds (bigint) and converted in the UI using UTC-based helpers to avoid timezone drift for calendar dates.",
    "Backend keeps domain data primarily embedded within the Resident record (medications, MAR, ADL, vitals, weight log) rather than fully normalized collections.",
    "Caffeine blob-storage mixin provides gateway authorization list refresh, dead-blob enumeration/pruning, and cashier cycle refill workflow.",
    "Build/deploy template expanded into a reusable React + shadcn/ui starter with standardized canister YAMLs, workspace package management, and helper scripts (e.g., resize/prune unused images).",
    "Frontend template adds custom ESLint rules to enforce safe patterns (e.g., prohibit BigInt in React Query keys; require explicit Internet Identity provider configuration).",
    "Authorization (AccessControl + MixinAuthorization) and blob-storage (Mixin/Storage) modules were updated as versioned components (authorization v4.0.0, blob-storage v4.0.0), implying their public interfaces/behavior are now aligned with those component releases."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "backend/main.mo calculateAge() is a stub (uses now = 0), so backend age calculations will be incorrect if used.",
    "frontend has two different index.css files shown; if both exist in the repo/build pipeline, styles/variables may conflict unpredictably.",
    "Motoko env var names for storage appear misspelled with triple 'F' (e.g., CAFFFEINE_STORAGE_CASHIER_PRINCIPAL), which can cause runtime traps if deployment uses different names.",
    "Backend stores physicians/pharmacy/insurance/responsiblePersons as resident-embedded records while also having separate Maps and add* functions; this split suggests incomplete normalization or unused global registries.",
    "AccessControl.getUserRole traps 'User is not registered' for authenticated principals until initialization runs; frontend calls _initializeAccessControlWithSecret but misconfiguration can lead to unexpected traps.",
    "MAR entry stores a full Medication object provided by the client; if medication details change later, historical MAR records may not reflect the original administered values consistently.",
    "Some backend functions (e.g., addPhysician/addPharmacy/addInsurance/addResponsiblePerson) exist but are not surfaced in the shown UI flows.",
    "Resident deletion removes the resident record but does not explicitly reclaim or clean up any associated blob storage resources (if added later).",
    "Resident profiles intermittently disappear (backend issue causing resident records to become missing/not retrievable)."
