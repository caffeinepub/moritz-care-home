        "When calling backend admin-gated methods (e.g., resident create/update/discharge/archive/delete) while authenticated as `hrxqg-aty7r-ze5hr-pldpb-ool7h-fy2rn-npy5t-lvtmr-lccbl-bdj53-pae`, the backend does not trap with an unauthorized error.",
        "The frontend `useIsCallerAdmin` query returns `true` for the Principal `hrxqg-aty7r-ze5hr-pldpb-ool7h-fy2rn-npy5t-lvtmr-lccbl-bdj53-pae`.",

    "Do not add new authentication providers or any third-party auth; keep Internet Identity as-is.",
